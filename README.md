# Interview Questions

These questions are made to allow a candidate to demonstrate their ability and comfort level in writing scripts and programs that may be similar in spirit to actual work they will be assigned to while working as a team member.

These are meant to be fairly general, vague and open-ended such that the candidate has freedom to decide how to approach, design and implement them based on their abilities, skill set and preferred methods.

## Notes to candidate

- Please use the programming language of your choice.
- You can use any IDE or setup.
- Feel free to use a search engine or any other online resource as needed.
- Please put emphasis on communication with the interviewer as you are working.
- Make sure to ask as many questions as needed.
- Once the problem is clear, walk the interviewer through the proposed plan prior to any implementation.
